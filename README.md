Opportunities project is one of my home assignments given by company X.
I was provided with a dummy data about company's clients and their histories,
my goal was to make UI according this data, that would visualize all the
information and make it as simple to understand as possible.
For achieving this goal, I had to learn some UI/UX, design systems, color 
palettes, did some research in Figma and chose best practices that I found.
Implemented recharts library for visualizing data.
Learnt important concepts of Material UI and implemented in project.
Divided data by values, implemented chart with a custom slider for 
rendering client's history records of different time periods.
Implemented next and previous buttons in card component, so the user can
check other client's data without closing the window.
And finally made it responsive for all devices, from small phones to large
displays.
